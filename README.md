# Solar Energy Market Growth

Introduction

    In this project, I set out to look at energy data to
    determine solar energy's market growth and outlook.
    The data I used came from the US Energy Information
    Administration (EIA). You can find the data sets
    here (https://www.eia.gov).

SQL

    My data upload syntax and queries can be found in the Capstone Project folder.
        
    For these queries, I looked at state level solar data to
    determine what states generated the most solar energy and also
    looked at energy generators from all energy sources to 
    determine which energy sources were losing generators and which
    have gained generators.

Tableau

    You can view my Tableu dashboards here (https://public.tableau.com/profile/collin.denzin#!/vizhome/DAClassCapstone/PrimaryEnergyMarketOverview?publish=yes).

    I included information on primary energy consumption as well
    as their compounded growth rates. I did the same for renewable
    energy sources as well and included the Top 3 energy sources by
    estimated generators added for the next 3 years. Lastly, their
    is a solar generation map on the state level.

Excel

    I created a pivot table using the solar generation by state 
    where you can filter by state and year to see the states solar
    generation. The file can be found in the Capstone Project folder.
